## Why ThisVid Downloader

ThisVid pages can vary a lot because uploads come from different sources and the site can expose either direct files or streaming variants. That makes generic tools unreliable. They often grab the wrong asset, miss the quality selector, or fail when playback only initializes after user interaction.

ThisVid Downloader is designed for that real workflow. Start the page, let the extension detect the stream, then export the version you want without leaving the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported ThisVid video streams from active pages
- Flashvars extraction and real-time HLS interception for reliable detection
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Reads available resolution variants when the source exposes them
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Exports MP4 files for offline viewing
- Automatic saving into a dedicated THISVID folder
- Desktop notifications when downloads complete
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open ThisVid and visit a video page.
3. Start playback so the extension can detect the stream.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button.
5. Choose the quality or stream option you want.
6. Download the video as MP4.
7. Save the final file locally.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Videos from ThisVid

9. Open the saved file from your Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported ThisVid video streams (HLS, direct MP4)

## Who It's For

- ThisVid viewers who want offline access to supported videos
- Users who need a cleaner alternative to manual stream extraction

- Anyone who wants cleaner download controls than generic downloader sites

## Common Use Cases

- Keep local copies of videos you can already watch in the browser
- Use the in-page button or right-click menu for a faster download flow

## Troubleshooting

Press play first and wait for the player to fully load.

Refresh the page and retry after playback starts again.

**Only one quality is listed**
